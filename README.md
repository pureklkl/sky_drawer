# sky_drawer

A sky drawing program in C++ by simulating the atmospheric model.
Implemented the Nishita sky drawing algorithm which simulated the sky color by ray casting and volume rendering. 
Accelerated the program by 2 times by pre-computing the rendering parameters and building a lookup table.
Accelerated the program by 100 times by implementing the code in OpenCL which ran on an intel Graphic HD Platform.
